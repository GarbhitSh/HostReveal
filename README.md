# HostReveal - Cyber Threat Investigation & Hosting Unmasking Tool

## Project Overview

HostReveal is a cybersecurity investigation and threat intelligence tool designed to unmask hidden hosting providers, identify malicious infrastructure, and provide machine learning-powered insights. In an age where services like Cloudflare mask the real origin servers, HostReveal helps security researchers, penetration testers, and SOC teams:

* Go beyond traditional DNS lookups
* Perform deep SSL inspection, packet analysis, and network mapping
* Integrate machine learning to detect anomalies and threats

## Key Features

### Domain & DNS Intelligence

* WHOIS queries, DNS records, passive DNS, reverse DNS
* IP Geolocation and hosting insights

### Network Scanning & SSL Analysis

* Nmap, Masscan scanning
* SSL Certificate Transparency logs inspection
* Network path tracing

### Packet Capture & Advanced Analysis

* Auto packet parsing with Zeek, Suricata, TCPFlow
* Traffic fingerprinting and risk analysis

### Threat Intelligence Correlation

* Integrate with OTX, MISP, Shodan, Censys
* Malicious IP detection & risk scoring

### Machine Learning Pipeline (ML Module)

* DBSCAN clustering of infrastructure
* RandomForest classification of risky hosts
* Deep learning-based anomaly detection
* Time-series forecasting using Prophet

### Interactive Streamlit Dashboard

* Visualize geolocation maps, risk graphs, and ML results
* Dark mode support, report analysis, and ML insights

### Automated Report Generation

* JSON & CSV output
* PDF/HTML report capability (optional)
